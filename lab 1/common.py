def swap(a,b):
    return b, a
    # temp = a
    # a = b
    # b = temp
    # return a, b

# You can either use third var 'temp' and return 'a', 'b' in the same order as the function takes the arguments.  i.e. a, b in this function
# OR
# Simply just return the values of 'a' and 'b' by swapping the order in which the arguments were taken by the functions
